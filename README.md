# Associative Alignment for Few-shot Image Classification
This paper proposes the idea of associative alignment for leveraging part of the base data by aligning the novel training instances to the closely related ones in the base training set. We propose two associative alignment strategies: 1) a metric-learning loss for minimizing the distance between related base samples and the centroid of novel instances in the feature space, and 2) a conditional adversarial alignment loss based on the Wasserstein distance.
