# [Associative Alignment for Few-shot Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05094)
This paper proposes associative alignment with two strategies: 1) a metric-learning loss for minimizing the distance between related base samples and the centroid of novel instances in the feature space, and 2) a conditional adversarial alignment loss based on the Wasserstein distance.
