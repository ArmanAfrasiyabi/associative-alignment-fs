# Associative Alignment for Few-shot Image Classification
This paper proposes associative alignment with two strategies: 1) a metric-learning loss for minimizing the distance between related base samples and the centroid of novel instances in the feature space, and 2) a conditional adversarial alignment loss based on the Wasserstein distance.


  

This repository **is going to** contain the pytorch implementation of Associative Alignment for Few-shot Image Classification [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05094) [presentation](https://github.com/ArmanAfrasiyabi/associative-alignment-fs/blob/master/Associative%20Alignmentfor%20Few-Shot%20Image%20Classification.pdf).
