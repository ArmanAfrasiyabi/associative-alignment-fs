# Associative Alignment for Few-shot Image Classification
This paper proposes associative alignment with two strategies: 1) a metric-learning loss for minimizing the distance between related base samples and the centroid of novel instances in the feature space, and 2) a conditional adversarial alignment loss based on the Wasserstein distance.


  

This repository will contains the pytorch implementation of Associative Alignment for Few-shot Image Classification [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05094).
